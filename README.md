# Ex-3-RECOGNITION-OF-A-VALID-ARITHMETIC-EXPRESSION-THAT-USES-OPERATOR-AND-USING-YACC
# Date: 11/04/2025
# AIM
To write a yacc program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,- ,* and /.
# ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the operators =,+,-,*,/ and for the identifier.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc –d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter an arithmetic expression as input and the tokens are identified as output.
# PROGRAM
```
%{
#include "y.tab.h"
%}

%%

"=" { printf("\n Operator is EQUAL"); return '='; } "+" { printf("\n Operator is PLUS"); return PLUS; }
"-" { printf("\n Operator is MINUS"); return MINUS; }
"/" { printf("\n Operator is DIVISION"); return DIVISION; }
"*" { printf("\n Operator is MULTIPLICATION"); return MULTIPLICATION; } [a-zA-Z]*[0-9]* { printf("\n Identifier is %s", yytext); return ID; }
. { return yytext[0]; }
\n { return 0; }

%%

int yywrap() { return 1;
}



// arth.y file

%{
#include <stdio.h>
/* This YACC program is for recognizing the Expression */
%}

%token ID PLUS MINUS MULTIPLICATION DIVISION

%%

statement: ID '=' E {
printf("\nValid arithmetic expression");
$$ = $3;
}
;
 
E: E PLUS ID
| E MINUS ID
| E MULTIPLICATION ID
| E DIVISION ID
| ID
;

%%
extern FILE* yyin; int main() {
do {
yyparse();
} while (!feof(yyin)); return 0;
}

void yyerror(char *s) { fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", s);
}
```

# RESULT
A YACC program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,-,* and / is executed successfully and the output is verified.
